# Backend README

## Description
This is the backend of the Atom Bomb Order App. It handles the business logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend.

## Files
1. `app.py`: Main entry point for the Flask application.
2. `models.py`: Contains database models using SQLAlchemy.
3. `utils.py`: Utility functions for the backend.
4. `/routes/auth_routes.py`: Contains routes for user authentication.
5. `/routes/order_routes.py`: Contains routes for handling bomb orders.
6. `/routes/support_routes.py`: Contains routes for chat support feature.
7. `/routes/feedback_routes.py`: Contains routes for user feedback.

## Dependencies
- Flask 2.0.1
- SQLAlchemy
- bcrypt 4.0.1

## Interconnected Files
- `app.py` interacts with all route files to handle incoming requests.
- `models.py` is used by `app.py` and route files to interact with the database.
- `utils.py` contains helper functions used across different parts of the backend.

## Functionality
- Authentication routes handle user login and registration.
- Order routes manage the creation and customization of atom bomb orders.
- Support routes enable users to chat with customer support.
- Feedback routes allow users to submit reviews and suggestions for the service.

## Error Handling
- Proper error handling is implemented throughout the backend to provide informative responses to clients.
- Exception logging is in place to track and resolve any issues that may arise.

## Security
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt to protect user data.
- Input validation is performed to prevent malicious attacks.
- APIs like Stripe and Twilio are integrated securely to handle payments and chat support.

## Scalability
- The backend is designed to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- Database queries are optimized for performance to ensure fast response times.

## Maintenance
- Regular updates and maintenance are carried out to fix bugs and enhance features.
- Code is version-controlled using Git to track changes and collaborate with other developers.
