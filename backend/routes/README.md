## Route files:
- `auth_routes.py`: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- `order_routes.py`: Manages the creation and customization of atom bomb orders.
- `support_routes.py`: Provides chat support functionality for users.
- `feedback_routes.py`: Implements the feedback system for user reviews.

Each route file contains specific endpoints and logic related to its functionality. The routes are interconnected to provide a seamless user experience while ordering and customizing atom bombs, receiving support, and providing feedback.

Ensure to handle errors gracefully and maintain a secure environment for all interactions within the app. The routes should communicate effectively with the backend logic and database to process orders, handle user authentication, and store feedback data securely.

The route files should follow the RESTful API design principles and adhere to the project's tech stack, using Python with Flask for backend development. Regularly update and maintain the routes to enhance security and performance.
